# SFTPing Into The Phone

Once you have your files ready, you can now install them on your phone.

To log into your phone, you need to open the program that allows SFTP connections that was referenced in [Preparing Tweaks](prepare-tweaks).

Once open, navigate to the connect section. Make sure that SFTP is selected.

{: .notice--info}

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/select-ftp.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

Now that SFTP is selected, use the IP from [SSHing into your device](ssh) and input it into the field "Server".

Next, in the "Username" and "Password" fields, input `root` for the username and `alpine` for the password (unless you changed it).

Click connect. If done correctly, a window like this should come up:

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/fingerprint.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

Click `Always`, then `Allow`.

Your STFP client should open up to this:

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/connection-success.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

# Navigating around

The default directory is `/private/var/root`.

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/privvarroot.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

This isn't the directory we need however. Using the navigation bar, get to `/`, or root.

Once in root, navigate to the `bootstrap` folder. This is where everything jailbreak-wise is handled.

![]({{ "/images/screenshots/bootstrap-view.png" | absolute_url }})
{: .notice--info}

Inside `bootstrap`, navigate to `Library`. This is where we will manually install tweaks.

Inside `Library`, there is only 5 important folders that we need: `Application Support`, `PreferenceBundles`, `PreferenceLoader`, `SBInject`, and `Themes`.
