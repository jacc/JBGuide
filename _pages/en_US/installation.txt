##Installing Electra via Impactor

Once you have gathered everything needed to jailbreak your device, go ahead and start Impactor. It should look like this:

[![Impactor start up screen]({{ "/images/impactor-view.png" | absolute_url }})]

Go ahead now and plug your iDevice in. If it is recognized without an issue, it should look something like this:

[![Impactor start up screen]({{ "/images/impactor-view.png" | absolute_url }})]
