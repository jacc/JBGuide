## Tweaks

As you know from reading the home page, tweaks allow you to customize your device.

Some tweaks are not compatible with iOS 11. Please check the tweak compatibility list before installing any tweaks

## Installing Tweaks

To install tweaks, you will need a program that allows SFTP connections. For Windows, this would be `WinSCP`, and on macOS, `Cyberduck`

Once you download the program for your operating software, download the tweak that you would like to install. Usually, this is in the form of a `.deb` file.

Double click (or unzip) the `.deb` file. Once unzipped, open the folder. Inside, there should be three files: `control.tar.gz`, `data.tar.gz`, and `debian-binary`. Unzip `data.tar.gz`.
