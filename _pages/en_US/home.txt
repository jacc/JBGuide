## What is jailbreaking?

Jailbreaking is defined as "modify (a smartphone or other electronic device) to remove restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or operator, e.g. to allow the installation of unauthorized software.".

Essentially, jailbreaking allows root access to your iOS device using exploits found in the iOS software.

## What does this guide install?

If followed correctly, this guide will take your stock iOS device and install a semi-untethered jailbreak onto your device.

## What can I do once jailbroken?

+ Root file access to your device(s).
+ Access to Cydia, a powerful package manager that handles all things customization of your iDevice.
+ Install tweaks, which add features to your iDevice.
+ Install themes, which change the look and feel of your icons.

## What do I need to know before starting?

Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking: Every time you rejailbreak, install a tweak, respring, or modify your system in any way, there is always a chance that you could either 1. BRICK your device, which CANNOT be fixed (extremely rare), or 2. get caught in a respring loop, potentially causing you to restore, losing your jailbreak. ALWAYS save your [blobs](faq#faq_saveblobs) and set your [nonce](blobs#nonce) so that if this happens, you can get back to a jailbreakable version.
{: .notice--warning}
+ This guide will work on any device on iOS 11.0-11.4b3.
+ If followed from beginning to end, you will be jailbroken without any data loss.
+ Keep the device plugged into to a power source so that any unexpected power off will be prevented.
