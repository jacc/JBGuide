# Opening Electra

Once you see the Electra icon on your homescreen, go ahead and open it. (If it gives you an untrusted developer error, go to Settings > General > Profiles > (your Apple ID email) > Trust)

If all is well, the application should look something like this:

# Running Electra

Go ahead and run the jailbreak.

The first time you run Electra, it will reboot your device to apply patches for the r/w remount. This is completely normal.
{: .notice--warning}

After the device reboots, reopen the Electra and click jailbreak again.

**YOU WILL NOT, I REPEAT ****WILL NOT**** GET ELECTRA WORKING THE FIRST ATTEMPT IF YOU ARE USING MULTI_PATH/VFS. ELECTRA WILL TAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES, TURN ON AIRPLANE MODE, WAIT A FEW MINUTES, THEN TRY TO JAILBREAK AGAIN. THE MEDIAN ATTEMPTS ARE USUALLY AROUND 10-50 TRIES. PLEASE BE PATIENT.**
{: .notice--danger}

## Errors Running

There are multiple errors that you can encounter during Electra. Here is a list and their fixes:
- Error: amfid patch: [Fix](faq#amfid)
- Can't get past 1/3: [Fix](faq#13)
- Error: rootfs remount: [Fix](faq#rootfs)

# Post Respring

After respringing, reopen Electra. If it succeeded, Electra should look like this:

Cydia should also be installed along side Electra. **Congratulations, your device is now jailbroken!**

If Cydia does not appear after respringing, try to SSH into your device using WinSCP, PuTTY, or Terminal and run `uicache`. If that doesn't make it appear, reboot and try again.
