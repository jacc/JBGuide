# Opening Electra

Once you see the Electra icon on your homescreen, go ahead and open it. (If it gives you an untrusted developer error, go to Settings > General > Profiles > (your Apple ID email) > Trust)

If all is well, the application should look something like this:

# Running Electra

The first time you run Electra, it will reboot your device to apply patches for the r/w remount. This is completely normal.

After the device reboots, reopen the Electra and click jailbreak again.


**YOU WILL NOT, I REPEAT **WILL NOT** GET ELECTRA WORKING THE FIRST ATTEMPT IF YOU ARE USING MULTI_PATH/VFS. ELECTRA WILL TAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES, TURN ON AIRPLANE MODE, WAIT A FEW MINUTES, THEN TRY TO JAILBREAK AGAIN. THE MEDIAN ATTEMPTS ARE USUALLY AROUND 10-50 TRIES. PLEASE BE PATIENT.
