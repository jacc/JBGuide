## What is jailbreaking?

Jailbreaking is defined as "modify (a smartphone or other electronic device) to remove restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or operator, e.g. to allow the installation of unauthorized software.".

Essentially, jailbreaking allows root access to your iOS device using exploits found in the iOS software.

## What does this guide install?

If followed correctly, this guide will take your stock iOS device and install a semi-untethered jailbreak onto your device.

Electra's core is based around a daemon called **jailbreakd**. A daemon is a process that runs in the background all the time. `jailbreakd` is the daemon that patching setuid for processes, platformising them, and handing certain entitlements out.

Electra is also different from other jailbreaks. Electra is a KPPLess jailbreak; which means that Electra cannot patch the kernel. Using `jailbreakd`, it places patches where kernel patches would usually be.

## What can I do once jailbroken?

+ Root file access to your device(s)
+ Install tweaks, which enhance or add new features to your smartphone
+ Install themes, which customize the look and feel of your phone.

## What do I need to know before starting?

Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking: Every time you rejailbreak, install a tweak, respring, or modify your system in any way, there is always a chance that you could either 1. BRICK your device, which CANNOT be fixed (extremely rare), or 2. get caught in a respring loop, causing you to restore, losing your jailbreak. ALWAYS save your blobs so that if this happens, you can get back to a jailbreakable version.
{: .notice--warning}
+ This guide will work on any device on iOS 11.0-11.1.2
