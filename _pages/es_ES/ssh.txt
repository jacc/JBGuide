## What is SSHing?

SSH is defined as "SSH, also known as Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that provides administrators with a secure way to access a remote computer."

SSH allows you to run commands on your device, much like commands you can run on a computer.

To find your device IP, go to Settings > WiFi > `your router name` > IP Address

# SSHing into the Device
Open up your favorite terminal program, and type in this command `root@your-device-ip`.

If done correctly, it should ask for a password. Type in `alpine`.

When logging in, if anything comes up that says "authenticity can't be confirmed" or something of the like, type `yes`.

# Navigating

The commands are a bit limited inside the device. However, basic commands like `cd` (change directory) and `ls` (list) are available.
